# HR-Employee-Attrition---Classification
In this project we take data of HR-Employee-Attrition Dataset and try to classify the attrition rate of the employees.
The data includes 1470 rows and 34 columns - including attrition, what we are trying to classify.
Preprocessed the data. 
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis. 
Imputed Missing Data. 
Split the data to 75/25 ratio. 
Scaled the data with Standard Scaler. 
Implemented PCA to reduce dimensionality. 
Performed various Machine learning Classification models with Cross-Validation and Grid Search - Voting Classifier, Dummy Classifier, K Neighbors Classifier, Decison Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier with Kernel (Linear, poly, rbf)
Also, performed ensemble techniques like Bagging, Pasting, Adaboost boosting & Gradient boosing to improve the accuracy of the moels. 
Executed deep learning model with Keras Classifier
Conclusion: Best regression model is KNN Regressor.
